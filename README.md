# surge [original version]
SURGE - An assessment item at the Queensland University of Technology. This was my first experience learning React & the front-end + back-end was built within 5 days (may 8th - may 13th). The goal of the assessment was to create a front-end & back-end which would serve NYSE data as JSON depending on authentication.
